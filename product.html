	<h2>Types Of Dongle</h2>
	<div class='dongl'>Original Dongle</div>
	<img src="images/dongleperf.png">
	<div><p>Original Dongle is one of our best selling Dongo and has an everchanging recipe.  Each generation of dongle has changed according to what kingdom's borders were covering our shop and currently we are inside the boreders of roland.  Our recipe to make Dongle has always stayed the same the only changes are in our secret batter.  We make Dongle by shaping our batter to different size balls and cooking them part way, then dipping them in the candy coating, pink is Strawberry, green is Apple, and yellow is Lemon.  After they are coated we put a stick through them and put them back in the oven, to cook fully through.</p></div>
	<div class='dongl'>Peppered Dongle</div>
